                        <ol>
                            <li><b> Hiking Clothes:</b> Choosing the right clothing for a hike helps impact your
                                comfort,
                                performance, and safety on the trail.</li>
                            <li> <b>Hiking Footwear:</b> Having the right footwear is essential for comfort, safety and
                                avoiding
                                injury.</li>
                            <li> <b>Backpack:</b> Some people overdo it here. You need to find the backpack that suits
                                you
                                and
                                not
                                one you
                                saw that looks snazzy or one that‚Äôs way too big.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Navigation:</b> As much as we plan, it‚Äôs still easy to get lost. A compass, map, and
                                GPS
                                helps

                                your route, identify landmarks and features, and stay on course.</li>

                            <li> <b>Lighting:</b> Even if you don‚Äôt plan to be out late, at the very least bring a
                                headtorch,
                                flashlight, and
                                extra batteries.</li>
                            <li><b>First Aid Kit:</b> A first aid kit is a vital piece of equipment for any hike for
                                treating
                                minor injuries
                                or emergencies on the trail.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Gear Repair Kit:</b> A simple kit to easily fix any damaged gear on the trails.</li>
                            <li> <b> Sun Protection:</b> There‚Äôs a lot more to sun protection on the trail than just
                                packing
                                sun
                                cream.</li>

                            <li> <b>Water & Snacks:</b> Avoid dehydration and fatigue. Pack the right food for fuel and
                                water to
                                replace any
                                lost fluids.</li>
                            <li> <b>Hiking Poles:</b> We always see these as optional and situational, but they do have
                                great
                                benefits on

                        <p class="card-text">Camping is a recreational (and oftentimes laid-back) activity pursued
                            outdoors,
                            away from cities and towns and in the lap of nature, with fresh air and (occasionally)
                            wildlife
                            for company. One can set up a tent, or live in a caravan, camper-van or motor-home when
                            camping.
                            But the classic camping trip involves toughing it out in tents ‚Äì and at the mercy of Mother
                            Nature.</p>

                                Tent, torch/flashlight/lantern, sleeping bag, lockable duffel bag (recommended),
                                Therm-a-Rest/air mattress, Swiss Army knife, stove, whistle, lighter, hammer/mallet (to

                                and sanitizer. Don‚Äôt forget to pack rations you might need in an emergency.</li>

                                Campers are fortunate to have the sky as a roof, and the earth as a floor ‚Äì don‚Äôt take
                                your
                                environs for granted. Since camping is, by and large, pursued outdoors, it is important
                                to
                                not disturb the inhabitants of the area, and their habitats. When setting up camp, be
                                ecologically sensitive to your immediate surroundings, intruding as little as possible
                                on
                                the flora and fauna of the area. And do not litter ‚Äì bring trash bags to dispose of all
                                rubbish.</li>

                                Out in the open, you‚Äôll come across denizens of the wilderness who might think you‚Äôre
                                trespassing on their territory, so do maintain a respectful distance. Come well prepared
                                (see equipment), and ready for any emergency. Nature, in the form of the animal kingdom
                                and
                                the weather, does tend to spring some nasty surprises, so make sure you have your wits
                                about
                                you. And come equipped with bucketloads of patience!</li>

                            <li> <b>Dry bag:</b> a small, waterproof bag that you can fill with belongings and fit into
                                the
                                kayak hatch.</li>

                                your feet.</li>
                            <li><b> Life jacket:</b> you always need a life jacket when paddling, no exceptions.</li>
                            <li> <b> Extra clothes:</b> always bring more layers in case the weather turns for the
                                worse.

                            <li>Do you have to be able to swim to kayak? Yes. Unless you are kayaking in a body of water
                                where you know you can touch the bottom, it is important you can swim if things get
                                dicey.
                            </li>
                            <li>Never drink alcohol and paddle.</li>
                            <li>Never paddle alone.</li>
                            <li>Choose calm bays, quiet lakes, or rivers without a noticeable current.</li>
                            <li>Always dress for the temperature of the water and bring extra clothes in case it gets
                                cold.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Always kayak with a lifejacket! Kayaking without one is a big no-no in the community
                                (even
                                dogs must wear vests when kayaking!).
                                Remember sunscreen if it‚Äôs sunny.</li>
